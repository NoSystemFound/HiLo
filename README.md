# HiLo
This is my first Java project. In this project you have to guess the number. You can use an easter egg (or a hint, it's all in one) and guess the number right away. Please do not enter non-integer data!!! It crashes the program!
#Booting
Windows: Install Java, use the command line to go to the directory where the file is located, and enter the command: java -jar HiLo.jar
After that, you will run the program.
Linux: Same
